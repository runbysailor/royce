<br />
Our firm exclusively manages <b>commercial</b> real estate investments, with a<br />
particular focus on the general and medical office product type. In a<br />
business that hinges on ethics and capabilities, we remain<br />
committed to the following five pillars of service:<br />
<br />
<b>LOYALTY</b><br />
A manager's motivations should never come into question.<br />
Our role is to provide guidance and a neutral perspective,<br />
but our clients' needs and wishes are our absolute priority.<br />
<br />
<b>DEDICATION</b><br />
The growth of our company in 2010 will be limited to five exclusive clients,<br />
which will allow us to maintain an unmatched level of service.<br />
<br />
<b>CONCENTRATION</b><br /> 
By managing only local investments with no residential component,<br />
we are able to tailor our efforts to a very specific market.<br />
<br />
<b>COMPREHENSIVENESS</b><br />
Asset management extends far beyond facility maintenance. We strive to<br />
maximize profit in every aspect of operations and decision making, and<br />
are always conscious of our clients' unique needs and exit strategies.<br />
<br />
<b>INNOVATION</b><br />
Every day is a new learning opportunity and a chance to provide a<br />
creative solution. Using technology and critical thinking, we provide an<br />
unconventional perspective in an evolving and competitive environment.<br />
