In 1908, Josiah Royce, an American philosopher,<br />
wrote that "loyalty is the supreme moral good",<br />
and that "devotion to an object is more important<br />
than the object itself." We propose that an asset<br />
manager's loyalty to its client is similarly paramount.<br />
It is our mission to embody the spirit of Royce's<br />
beliefs throughout our service, and to uphold the<br />
needs of our clients without reservation.<br />
